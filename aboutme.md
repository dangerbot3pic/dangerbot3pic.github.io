### The Journey So Far


Here's my education in a nutshell:

- Between 2012 and 2016, I was a student at Pitsford School, completing my GCSEs in 2014, and A-Levels in 2016.

- In 2016 I began an MEng in Electronic and Information Engineering at Imperial College London. I graduated in 2020 with First-class honours.

- Since October 2020, I have been a Computer Science PhD student at Imperial College.


### Where I've worked

An overview of my work experience so far:

- I worked in a Cybersecurity firm over summer in 2018. Here I worked on a number of projects, such as a secure communication application and aprorietary data viewer. I also picked up a bunch of key skills in penetration testing, reverse engineering and information extraction.

- I then interned at Credit Suisse the following year where I worked on an AI assistant using Word2vec and Starpspace to perform NLP.
