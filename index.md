I am a PhD student in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. My research interests are in machine learning, mostly reinforcement learning.

Reinforcement learning trains polices that maximize the expected reward over a long time horizon. This is done through trial and error, which is can be horribly data inefficient. 

My work focusees on *offline* reinforcement learning, which effectively learns from trial and error learning without the trial and error aspect. Instead, offline RL learns from *suboptimal* demonstrations to recover an expert policy, at least as expert as possible within the scope of the dataset.
