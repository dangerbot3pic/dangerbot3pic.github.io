We all need a hobby. This is something I realised as I was coming to the end of my undergrad degree. This was compounded by the fact that this time was prime Coronavirus season. Daily lunchtime TV was spent watching the news as if performing a precise and organsied routine. I would begin with BBC News, followed by a foray into US News through (yeah, I know!) CNN and finishing off with an Asian dessert of NHK. 

Outside of watching the news, I was working on my Master's thesis and a few other bits and pieces. Also, at this time I was living at home and there was no way I could see my friends or go to university. It just so happens that our garden is home to several mature trees: two Norway Maples each at least 75 years old, as well as two English Oaks, one around 80 years old and the other over 100 years old! 

Every autumn the oaks and the maples would pepper the lawn with acorns and sycamores. Naturally, most wouldn't germinate as they were scooped up by squirrels or the gardeners, but some lucky individuals would fall in a spot not frequented by either of these and would start growing. 

So now comes my bonsai story. I used to garden when I was younger, growing marrows, strawberries and a whole host of other plants. Once, I even won first place at in a sunflower growing contest! I wanted to get back into gardening and bonsai seemed interesting. Cue the copious amounts of reading online and YouTube ([Herons Bonsai](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyZR5OfKC6sQ6fKHDzlruNw) has some awesome videos) I decided to make a bonsai. 

A cursory walk around the garden yielded a prime candidate -- a two year old maple sapling. In the excitement of having a great and visually interesting, I dug it up and potted it.

But the fact is, good bonsai takes years to grow. So now I'm doing the waiting game. Maybe in a two or three years, I will finally be able to do some real work on it! Also in the pipeline are some other plants: an English Yew sapling (around two years old), cuttings from a Japanese Maple which I plan to fuse next year, as well as a Penjing landscape. Maybe I'll write about these in a later post :).
